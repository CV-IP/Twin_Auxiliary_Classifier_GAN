# Twin Auxiliary Classifier GAN

#### Requirements

* pytorch >=0.4.0
* torchvision ==0.2.0
* Jupyter Notebook

#### Datset 
* A distribution of 1D MoG having three overlapping mixture components with modes at 0, 3, 6, and 110, and standard
deviations of 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

#### Usage
* Run the Simple_GANs.ipynb to generate the results for vanilla GAN.
* For MAD-GAN run the Mad_GANs.ipynb to compare the results of vanillaGAN over MAD-GAN.
* Number of generater of MAD-GAN can by changing 'num_gen' and G.params().
